# gold_price_simulation

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict and simulate gold prices using advanced machine learning techniques.  
We applied the **ARIMA** model to analyze historical price trends and economic indicators.  

Data preprocessing included handling missing values and scaling for better model performance.  
The simulation provides insights into short-term and long-term gold price movements.  

Evaluation metrics such as **RMSE** and **MAE** were used to measure prediction accuracy.  

The project demonstrates how AI can support decision-making in financial forecasting.
